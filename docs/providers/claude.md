# Claude

Tracks your Claude subscription limits using the login you already have from Claude Code or Claude Desktop.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Sonnet | Separate weekly Sonnet limit (plan-dependent) |
| Fable | Separate weekly Fable limit (model-scoped window from the `limits` array) |
| Extra Usage | Extra-usage credits spent against your monthly cap |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend, as cost, tokens, or both (see below) |

When Claude reports your plan name, OpenUsage shows it beside the provider name.

## Where credentials come from

Sign in with Claude Code or Claude Desktop; OpenUsage reads the existing login. It checks these sources, preferring one that can read your subscription usage:

1. The macOS keychain entry Claude Code maintains (its source of truth on macOS)
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`)
3. Claude Desktop's encrypted login cache, when no working Claude Code login is available
4. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

Claude Desktop support is read-only. OpenUsage decrypts its currently valid access token using the
`Claude Safe Storage` item in your macOS Keychain. It never reads or uses Desktop's refresh token, and
never changes Desktop's config, cookies, or Keychain entry. This prevents OpenUsage from invalidating
Claude Desktop's session.

macOS asks once before OpenUsage can access that Keychain item. Background refreshes never open the
password dialog: OpenUsage first asks you to refresh manually, and choosing **Always Allow** makes later
refreshes silent. If Desktop's short-lived token expires, open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login,
then refresh OpenUsage.

A `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — usually a long-lived `claude setup-token` — can run the model but can't read your Session and Weekly limits, and it often lingers in your shell environment. So when a real keychain or file login is present, OpenUsage uses that login for the live meters and keeps the environment token only as a fallback; the Session/Weekly meters no longer go blank just because that token is set. If the environment token is your *only* credential (a headless setup), it's used on its own and the spend tiles still load from local logs.

If one source holds an expired or "locked out" token, OpenUsage falls back to the others — so signing in again with `claude` outside the app is picked up on the next refresh, without restarting OpenUsage. Claude Code tokens are refreshed automatically; rotated tokens are written back only while the ordered login candidates still match the start of the refresh, so a newly added higher-priority login wins. Claude Desktop tokens are never refreshed or written by OpenUsage.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally**: OpenUsage reads the Claude Code session logs under `~/.claude/projects/` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) itself — no external tools needed. Symlinks are followed, so a projects folder linked into a synced location (say, a Dropbox folder) is read all the same. Cowork (the Claude desktop app's agent mode) counts too: it writes the same logs into per-session folders under `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`, and OpenUsage scans those as well, so desktop agent sessions show up in the tiles alongside terminal ones. Days are grouped in your Mac's local time zone, so they line up with your own calendar. Each period is one tile showing cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`); a day with no usage reads **No data** rather than a misleading `$0.00 · 0 tokens` — the same as every other spend-tracking provider. The live Session and Weekly meters are unaffected. The dollars are estimated from token counts at API rates (that's the ⓘ) using the shared [model pricing](../pricing.md); the token counts themselves are measured. No log data leaves your Mac.

## Multiple accounts

If you're signed in to more than one Claude account on this Mac, the Claude card grows a small picker beside the provider name (the caret, like the Total Spend card's metric switch). Pick an account to swap the whole card — and any Claude metrics you've pinned to the menu bar — to that login's numbers. Nothing else changes: your metric layout, stars, and provider order are shared, only the data swaps.

- Extra accounts are found automatically at launch by listing the Claude Code entries in your keychain (each `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` login is its own entry) — no setup, nothing on disk is searched, and no secret is read until the account is actually refreshed. Only logins in **ongoing use** count: agent sandboxes and one-shot sessions leave behind keychain entries that are written once and never touched again (they can pile up by the hundreds), so an entry only becomes an account once it has kept rotating past its first day. A genuinely new second login therefore appears after about a day of use. The first refresh of an extra account can show macOS's usual one-time keychain permission dialog, once per account — the same dialog your main login showed.
- **Claude Desktop counts too.** If you're signed in to more than one account in the Claude desktop app, each additional organization becomes its own picker account (the active one already backs up the main card — see "Where credentials come from"). These are borrowed read-only the same way as the Desktop fallback: OpenUsage never refreshes them, so when one goes stale, open Claude Desktop and it renews itself. They appear once OpenUsage has the one-time Safe Storage permission (granted during a manual refresh), on the next launch after that.
- Rename or remove an extra account in Customize → Claude → **Accounts**. Renames apply immediately everywhere the name shows. Removing an account only makes OpenUsage forget it — the login itself is untouched, and one that still exists is found again on a later launch.
- The spend tiles (Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days) and the usage trend come from the session logs on this Mac, which belong to your default setup — so they show real numbers on the default account and **No data** while an extra account is selected.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `claude` and sign in, then refresh.
- **"Claude Desktop login found"** — refresh manually and choose **Always Allow** when macOS asks for access to `Claude Safe Storage`.
- **"Claude Desktop login is stale"** — open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login, then refresh OpenUsage.
- **"Re-login for live usage"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — your saved login can authenticate for inference but can't read your subscription limits, because it lacks the `user:profile` access (this is what an inference-only token from `claude setup-token` carries). Run `claude` and sign in again with your Claude account, then refresh; the spend tiles keep working in the meantime.
- **"Updates blocked by Anthropic"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — the usage API is throttling OpenUsage. It keeps the last values from the same login, shows when it will retry, and backs off in the meantime. A different login starts with a fresh cache and cooldown.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage found no Claude Code logs in the last 30 days. If your logs live somewhere custom, set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so both Claude Code and OpenUsage look in the same place.

## Under the hood

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the selected OAuth token. Claude Code tokens refresh via `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`; Claude Desktop tokens are read-only and must be renewed by Desktop itself. If a token is expired or revoked, OpenUsage retries with the next credential source before reporting an error.

When the five-hour session window has no usage yet, the Session row shows **Not started** on the trailing label; hover explains that the session begins after your first message.
